  Inserts quick exit button for sensitive interviews into
  the page header.
  
  Will not be compatible with all browsers. JQuery doesn't
  offer that kind of support.
  
  Why is this js in here, in `right:` instead of the static folder?
  Because when I tried that, the escape button only got
  created on the first page and then never again.
  
  Why is the css in here in that case?
  Because then they're both in the same file and I don't have
  to dig to find each and then jump around between them. If
  problems come up, we can deal with them.
