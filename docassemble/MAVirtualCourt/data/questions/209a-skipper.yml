  Allows selecting ways to skip 209A interview content.
  
  TODO:
  1. Create way to skip straight to PDF.
  1. Skipping sections vs. skipping PDF forms?
  1. Skip sections vs. skip intros + subject areas separately?
  1. Skip all informational screens separately from other bits?
  1. Version where you get to see every screen, but most info is pre-filled?
  1. Try to be clear about where different sections/questions are coming from.
  1. One item to pre-fill every possible name? That seems like too much time.
  
  Sections:
  1. Intro (all intros?)
  2. Plaintiff name/major/current address - all addresses?
  3. Filling out for someone else
  4. Defendant name/major/???
  5. Relationship
  6. Children, part 1?
  7. Abuse description
  8. Children, part 2?
  9. Orders to keep defendant away from plaintiff
  10. Custody
  11. Child support (children, part 3?)
  12. Defendant info
  13. Plaintiff info
  14. Privacy from others
  15. Past custody cases (children, part 4?)
  16. Past cases
  17. Signing/Filing
