question: |
  What to expect.
subquestion: |
  When you ask the court for an abuse prevention order, the judge can do three things.

  1.  Deny your request. Refuse to give you a restraining order.  The Defendant will not get any notice that you asked the court for a restraining order.

  2. Make a temporary order. The judge will decide what you need to protect you from  the Defendant until the 2nd hearing.  
  The judge will not order  the Defendant  to pay support or other money at this 1st hearing.  
  The 2nd hearing will be within 10 days of the temporary order. At the 2nd hearing the judge can hear from both you and the Defendant  at the same time.

  3.  Not make any order until they can hear from both you and the Defendant at the same time.  The judge may decide not to make an order at the first hearing if they think you will be safe from  "immediate danger of abuse" from  the Defendant.  If the judge decides not to make an order and you decide to go to a hearing where the judge can hear from both of you,  the Defendant will find out you have asked for a restraining order.
  
  Please contact a domestic violence advocate at (877) 785-2020 if you want to talk to someone more about what to expect in this process.

  There are four courts that you can choose from to get a 209A Restraining order.
  
  1. The Boston Municipal Court or District court may be close to where you live.
  2. There is only one Probate and Family Court and one Superior Court in
  most counties, which may be further away from where you live.
  
  You can get a 209A restraining order at the District Court near where you live or the Probate and Family Court in your county.  If you live in Boston, you can go to the Boston Municipal Court (BMC) near where you live instead of a District Court. You can also go to the Superior Court in your county.  Most people get 209A restraining orders from District Court, BMC, or Probate and Family Court.  Superior Court restraining orders are rare but may be an option when other available courts are closed due to the COVID-19 crisis. 
  
  If you have moved to another town in Massachusetts since the abuse, you can go to the court where you live now or to the court for an address that you had to leave because of the abuse. 
  
  Some things to think about when you are deciding which court is better for you are:  
  
  #### If the other parent wants to visit your child  
  The District Court is not supposed to order visitation between the other parent and your child as part of a 209A case. The Probate and Family Court can order visitation in a 209A case.  If you want to get visitation settled right away, you might want to go to the Probate and Family Court to file for the 209A restraining order. If you do not want the court to decide about visitation, you might want to go to the District Court for your 209A restraining order. 
  
  #### If the person who abused you is facing criminal charges  
  If the person who abused you is facing criminal charges related to the domestic violence, you might want to file for your 209A restraining order at the District or Superior Court where that case is. That way, you may be able to work with the same Victim/Witness Advocate for both cases.
