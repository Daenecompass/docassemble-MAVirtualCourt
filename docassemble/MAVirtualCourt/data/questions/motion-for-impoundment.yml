question:
  Keeping information private (impoundment)
subquestion: |
  If you need to keep any information on this form private, you have
  the right to ask for the court to "impound" information.

  The next section will ask you about information that you can
  keep private. If you decide to request information to be kept
  private, your court forms will include a "motion for impoundment".

question: |
  Keeping your addresses private
subquestion: |
  You can ask the court to keep your address information private.

  If you answer "Keep my address information private," the following information will be kept private
  from court personnel and police employees who would otherwise see it in their normal jobs.

  * Address where you live
  * Address of your school
  * Your telephone numbers
  
  **This will _not_ apply to any address you ask the court to order ${other_parties.familiar()}
  to keep away from.**

  Do you need to keep your addresses private?
yesno: impound_personal_information
help: |
  Pursuant to G.L. c. 209A, § 8 or G.L. c. 258E, § 10, your residential and
  workplace addresses: 

  * will automatically be kept from being disclosed to the
    public.
  * will automatically be kept from being disclosed to the defendant and
    the defendant’s attorney unless those addresses appear in the court Order
    becauseyou have requested that the defendant be ordered to remain away from
    your residence or workplace.
  * will be available to you, to your attorney, to
    those you authorize to have access, and to certain persons when access is
    necessary in the performance oftheir duties (prosecutors, law enforcement
    officers, victim-witness advocates, sexual assault counselors and, in G.L. c.
    209A cases only, domestic violence counselors).
  
  If you have good reasons why
  your addresses should not be disclosed to those who would otherwise have
  access in the course of their duties, you may file this motion with the court
  requesting a judge to issue an Order of impoundment under Trial Court Uniform
  Rule VIII on Impoundment Procedure. If you have good reasons, you may also
  request a judge to impound other information in this case from public
  inspection. You must explain why there is good cause for a judge to do so.
  Usually a general preference for privacy is not alone a sufficient reason for
  a judge to impound court records from public inspection. 
  
  If you are requesting
  an Order of impoundment without prior notice to the defendant and any other
  interested persons, you must explain why immediate and irreparable injury may
  otherwise result.

question: |
  Getting an order without notice to ${other_parties.familiar()}
subquestion: |
  If you need, you can keep this _request_ private.

  The judge may agree to give you an order that keeps your information private
  without letting ${other_parties.familiar()} know about your request in
  advance.

  You can ask for this if you will suffer "immediate and irreparable harm"
  if the court lets ${other_parties.familiar()} know about this request
  in advance.

  Do you need an order without giving notice to ${other_parties.familiar()}?
