question: |
  Is there any other information in the case that you'd want to be withheld from the public?
subquestion: |
  Draft: The defendant will still see all of this information. Privacy reasons are not enough. Sexual abuse information can sometimes be a good reason. todo: SMEs
fields:
  - 'Do you have a good reason that you want this information to be kept private?': impound_case_record_information
    datatype: yesno

question: |
  Draft: Do you want some of your addresses to be withheld from the public?
subquestion: |
  This will mean that the only addresses anyone will be able to see would be the addresses that you ask the court to order the defendant to stay away from. If police and domestic violence counselors absolutely need the information, they will see it.

  Alternatively this plus other descriptions:
  The defendant and other members of the public will only be able to see the addresses that you ask the court to order the defendant to stay away from.
yesno: impound_personal_information

question: |
  Why do you want to keep this form private?
subquestion: |
  Be specific. Include facts about your safety.  
fields:
  - no label: request_based_on

question: |
  Would you be hurt if people heard about this request in advance? (plain language)
subquestion: |
  Draft:
  If the defendant or someone else found out about this request before your hearing, could you be hurt, either physically or in another way (like ruining your reputation)?

  TODO: Next question:
  Would there be any way to repair this damage? If not, then
  impound_information_ex_parte would be False.
yesno: impound_information_ex_parte
